The vision of <b>The Rock of Faith Healing Assembly Int'l</b> began in 2012 during a critical period in my life. Born into the family of Robinson Onuorah, a household marked by my mother&rsquo;s covenant with God, I, Prophet Emmanuel Chibuike Onuorah, faced significant challenges as I grew. Despite my efforts, nothing I pursued succeeded, and I found myself in a cycle of frustration and despair.
</p>
<p>
In 2012, I attended a convention at SCOAN in Lagos, where the anointed man of God, the Late Prophet T.B. Joshua, delivered a prophetic message, saying, &ldquo;People are waiting for you.&rdquo; Although I didn&rsquo;t fully understand its meaning at the time, I clung to God&rsquo;s promises. Later that year, I traveled to Turkey in search of a breakthrough, but my efforts bore no fruit. In 2015, I journeyed to South Africa, spending a year there, but returned to Nigeria on January 1, 2016, without any significant progress.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of my struggles, my late father invited me to our village, where I encountered a pastor who discerned God&rsquo;s call upon my life. The pastor instructed me to embark on a seven-day fast and prayer, during which God would reveal Himself. I obeyed, and during this period of fasting, I experienced a divine encounter. In a trance, God spoke clearly, instructing me to separate myself from the crowd and prepare for His work.
</p>
<p>
Prior to this, I had prophesied to my late father, and the prophecy came to pass, affirming God&rsquo;s calling on my life. This marked the beginning of a deeper journey of devotion. I retreated to the mountain, dedicating two years and six months to worshiping and serving God in spirit and truth. During this period, God revealed the name of this ministry as <b>The Rock of Faith Healing Assembly Int'l (ROFHA)</b> and directed me to establish an altar in my father&rsquo;s house as the foundation for His work. I obeyed, and from that moment, the ministry began to flourish under God&rsquo;s guidance.
</p>
<p>
On August 4, 2018, <b>The Rock of Faith Healing Assembly Int'l</b> was officially established. Since then, by God&rsquo;s grace, the ministry has expanded, planting six branches across the nation with plans for further growth. Through Christ who strengthens us, we remain steadfast in building His kingdom and spreading the Gospel.

<p>
To God be the glory for the great and mighty things He has done!
